# I²-GCN Model Structure

This repository provides the model architecture files and configuration for the I²-GCN network proposed in our paper:  
**"A Graph Convolutional Network Framework for Area Attention and Tracking Compensation of In-orbit Satellite"**

## Included Files

- `model.py`: Full implementation of the model architecture
- `layers.py`: GCN layer definitions
- `config.yaml`: Sample hyperparameter configuration

## Note

Due to institutional confidentiality agreements, full training code and data cannot be shared at this time.  
We provide these artifacts to improve transparency and aid understanding of our architecture design.
